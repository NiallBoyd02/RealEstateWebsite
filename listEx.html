        <h1>Quotes from Richard Feynman</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Nobody ever figures out what life is all about, and it doesn't matter. Explore the world. Nearly everything is really interesting if you go into it deeply enough.</li>
            <li>I would rather have questions that can't be answered than answers that can't be questioned.</li> 
            <li>Study hard what interests you the most in the most undisciplined, irreverent and original manner possible.</li>
            <li>I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong.</li>   
            <li>We are at the very beginning of time for the human race. It is not unreasonable that we grapple with problems. But there are tens of thousands of years in the future. Our responsibility is to do what we can, learn what we can, improve the solutions, and pass them on.</li>
        </ul>
